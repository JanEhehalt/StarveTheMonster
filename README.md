# StarveTheMonster

[[_TOC_]] 

## General Information

"Protect the Monster" has been created for the [NoImage Gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/no-image-jam). It was developed by @JonathanHager and @GammelJAN. The main goal of this game is to prevent the monster
from eating the humans that run towards it.

## Installation
You can find the newest Jar file in *core/build/libs/*. If you wish to compile your own, you need to have the JDK and Gradle installed. Then run 
```bash
./gradlew desktop:dist
```
in the root directory of the project.
If you happen to be on Windows or any non-Unix platform, go get a good operating system (not MacOS!).

## Known Issues
The collisions should represent collisions in the real world. The physics for this system were written by ourselves, so problems may occur.

## Controls

Drag your mouse to create new walls which block off the humans.
